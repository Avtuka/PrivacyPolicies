<h1>Privacy Policy for Mafia Anchor</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 11/APR/2025</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Avtandigital</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Mafia Anchor</strong>, a fun party-style game for Android users. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information while using our app.</p>

<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not collect</strong>, store, or share any <strong>personally identifiable information</strong> (PII). You are not required to create an account, provide any email, or sign in to use the app.</p>

<h2>3. In-App Advertising</h2>
<p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve in-app ads. AdMob may collect <strong>anonymous usage data</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device information</li>
  <li>Ad interactions</li>
  <li>IP address (used for geotargeting and fraud prevention)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about how AdMob handles data <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>We do not have control over the data collected by third-party advertisers.</em></p>

<h2>4. Rewarded Ads</h2>
<p>Mafia Anchor offers <strong>rewarded ads</strong> that allow you to earn in-game coins. Coins are required to start a new game session. These coins are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and persist even after closing the app.</p>
<p>Watching rewarded ads is optional, but may be necessary to earn coins if your balance is low. The ads do not interfere with gameplay logic, and the app does not require an internet connection to function beyond loading the ads.</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Mafia Anchor is suitable for all age groups, including children. However, we do not knowingly collect any personal data from users of any age. All data remains on the device, and no sign-in or account creation is required. Ads displayed in the app are managed by Google AdMob and are subject to their own child-appropriate filters based on user settings and device configuration.</p>


<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not store any user data</strong> on external servers. All gameplay data (like player names and selections) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. Coin balances are also stored locally and not shared with us or third parties.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within this section of the app or on our official website.</p>
